## Executive Summary

This audit covers the Torch SDK v4.0.1, a TypeScript library that reads on-chain state from Solana and builds unsigned transactions for the Torch Market protocol. The SDK was cross-referenced against the live on-chain program (V4.0.1) to verify PDA derivation, quote math, vault integration, migration flow, lending accounting, and account handling. v3.7.17 includes V25 pump-style reserves, V26 permissionless migration, V27 treasury lock and PDA-based pool validation, removal of `update_authority` (V28), V20 swap fees to SOL, V29 on-chain Token-2022 metadata (Metaplex removal, 0.1% transfer fee), a critical lending accounting fix, and dynamic network detection.

The SDK is **stateless** (no global state, no connection pools), **non-custodial** (never touches private keys — all transactions are returned unsigned), and **RPC-first** (all data from Solana, no proprietary API for core operations).

### Overall Assessment

| Category | Rating | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| PDA Derivation | **PASS** | All 12 seeds match on-chain `constants.rs` exactly |
| Quote Math | **PASS** | Exact match with on-chain buy handler (BigInt, fees, dynamic rate, token split) |
| Vault Integration | **PASS** | Correct null/Some handling, wallet link derived from buyer (not vault creator) |
| Key Safety | **PASS** | No key custody — unsigned transaction pattern throughout |
| Input Validation | **PASS** | Slippage validated with explicit error, lengths checked, PublicKey constructor validates base58 |
| External APIs | **PASS** | SAID + CoinGecko + metadata URI — all degrade gracefully; metadata fetch uses direct `fetch()` with 10s AbortController timeout |
| Dependencies | **MINIMAL** | 4 runtime deps, all standard Solana ecosystem |

### Finding Summary

| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Critical | 0 |
| High | 0 |
| Medium | 0 |
| Low | 0 (3 resolved in v3.2.4) |
| Informational | 6 (I-2 resolved in v10.2.0) |

## Methodology

1. **Line-by-line source review** of all 10 SDK source files
2. **PDA seed cross-reference** between `constants.ts` and on-chain `constants.rs`
3. **Math cross-reference** between `program.ts:calculateTokensOut` and on-chain `handlers/market.rs:buy`
4. **Vault account cross-reference** between `transactions.ts:buildBuyTransaction` and on-chain `contexts.rs:Buy`
5. **E2E validation** via Surfpool mainnet fork (32/32 tests passed)

---

## PDA Derivation Correctness

All PDA seeds in the SDK were compared against the on-chain Rust program:

| PDA | SDK Seed (`constants.ts`) | On-Chain Seed (`constants.rs`) | Match |
|-----|--------------------------|-------------------------------|-------|
| GlobalConfig | `"global_config"` | `b"global_config"` | YES |
| BondingCurve | `["bonding_curve", mint]` | `[BONDING_CURVE_SEED, mint]` | YES |
| Treasury | `["treasury", mint]` | `[TREASURY_SEED, mint]` | YES |
| UserPosition | `["user_position", bonding_curve, user]` | `[USER_POSITION_SEED, bonding_curve, user]` | YES |
| UserStats | `["user_stats", user]` | `[USER_STATS_SEED, user]` | YES |
| ProtocolTreasury | `"protocol_treasury_v11"` | `b"protocol_treasury_v11"` | YES |
| StarRecord | `["star_record", user, mint]` | `[STAR_RECORD_SEED, user, mint]` | YES |
| LoanPosition | `["loan", mint, user]` | `[LOAN_SEED, mint, user]` | YES |
| CollateralVault | `["collateral_vault", mint]` | `[COLLATERAL_VAULT_SEED, mint]` | YES |
| TorchVault | `["torch_vault", creator]` | `[TORCH_VAULT_SEED, creator]` | YES |
| VaultWalletLink | `["vault_wallet", wallet]` | `[VAULT_WALLET_LINK_SEED, wallet]` | YES |

**Raydium PDAs** (under `RAYDIUM_CPMM_PROGRAM`):

| PDA | SDK Seed | Match |
|-----|----------|-------|
| Authority | `["vault_and_lp_mint_auth_seed"]` | YES |
| PoolState | `["pool", amm_config, token0, token1]` | YES |
| LP Mint | `["pool_lp_mint", pool_state]` | YES |
| Vault | `["pool_vault", pool_state, token_mint]` | YES |
| Observation | `["observation", pool_state]` | YES |

**Token ordering** for Raydium uses byte-level comparison (`token0 < token1`), matching Raydium convention. Implementation in `orderTokensForRaydium` (program.ts:334-351) iterates all 32 bytes.

**Verdict:** All PDA derivations are correct and match the on-chain program exactly.

---

## Quote Math Verification

### Buy Quote (`calculateTokensOut`)

SDK implementation (program.ts:243-299) was compared step-by-step against on-chain `buy` handler (market.rs:23-478):

| Step | SDK (BigInt) | On-Chain (u64/u128) | Match |
|------|-------------|---------------------|-------|
| Protocol fee | `solAmount * 50n / 10000n` | `sol_amount * protocol_fee_bps / 10000` | YES |
| Treasury fee | `solAmount * 0n / 10000n` (V10: 0%) | `sol_amount * TREASURY_FEE_BPS / 10000` (0) | YES |
| Sol after fees | `solAmount - protocolFee - treasuryFee` | `sol_amount - protocol_fee_total - token_treasury_fee` | YES |
| Dynamic rate bounds | `treasuryRateBounds(bondingTarget)` → per-tier (max, min) | `treasury_rate_bounds(bonding_target)` → per-tier (max, min) | YES |
| Dynamic rate range | `BigInt(bounds.max - bounds.min)` | `(max_bps - min_bps)` | YES |
| Decay | `realSolReserves * rateRange / resolvedTarget` | `reserves * rate_range / target` | YES |
| Rate floor | `Math.max(bounds.max - decay, bounds.min)` | `rate.max(min_bps)` | YES |
| Sol to treasury | `solAfterFees * treasuryRateBps / 10000` | `sol_after_fees * treasury_rate_bps / 10000` | YES |
| Sol to curve | `solAfterFees - solToTreasurySplit` | `sol_after_fees - sol_to_treasury_split` | YES |
| Tokens out | `virtualTokens * solToCurve / (virtualSol + solToCurve)` | `virtual_token_reserves * sol_to_curve / (virtual_sol_reserves + sol_to_curve)` | YES |
| Tokens to user | `tokensOut * 9000n / 10000n` | `tokens_out * (10000 - BURN_RATE_BPS) / 10000` where BURN_RATE_BPS=1000 | YES |
| Tokens to treasury | `tokensOut - tokensToUser` | `tokens_out - tokens_to_buyer` | YES |

**Key observation:** The SDK uses `BigInt` for all arithmetic, mirroring the on-chain `checked_mul`/`checked_div` behavior. Integer division truncation is identical in both environments.

### Sell Quote (`calculateSolOut`)

| Step | SDK | On-Chain | Match |
|------|-----|----------|-------|
| Sol out | `virtualSol * tokenAmount / (virtualTokens + tokenAmount)` | `virtual_sol_reserves * token_amount / (virtual_token_reserves + token_amount)` | YES |
| Fee | 0 (no sell fee) | `SELL_FEE_BPS = 0` | YES |

**Verdict:** Quote math is an exact match with the on-chain program.

---

## Vault Integration Review

### Buy Transaction — Vault Account Handling

The on-chain `Buy` context (contexts.rs:170-286) defines:

```rust
pub torch_vault: Option<Box<Account<'info, TorchVault>>>,
pub vault_wallet_link: Option<Box<Account<'info, VaultWalletLink>>>,
```

The `vault_wallet_link` constraint uses `buyer.key()` as the seed:
```rust
seeds = [VAULT_WALLET_LINK_SEED, buyer.key().as_ref()],
```

**SDK behavior** (transactions.ts:167-173):

```typescript
if (vaultCreatorStr) {
  const vaultCreator = new PublicKey(vaultCreatorStr)
  ;[torchVaultAccount] = getTorchVaultPda(vaultCreator)     // from creator
  ;[vaultWalletLinkAccount] = getVaultWalletLinkPda(buyer)  // from buyer
}
```

This is **correct**:
- Vault PDA is derived from the vault creator (the `vault` param)
- Wallet link PDA is derived from the buyer (the transaction signer)
- When not using vault, both are passed as `null` (Anchor treats as `None`)

### On-Chain C-1 Fix Verification

The on-chain buy handler (market.rs:30-39) includes the critical fix:

```rust
if ctx.accounts.torch_vault.is_some() {
    require!(
        ctx.accounts.vault_wallet_link.is_some(),
        TorchMarketError::WalletNotLinked
    );
}
```

The SDK always provides both vault accounts together or neither (transactions.ts:167-173), so the C-1 vulnerability path is not reachable through the SDK. However, the on-chain fix is the actual security boundary — the SDK is just a convenience layer.

### Vault Query Functions

| Function | Derivation | Verified |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| `getVault(creator)` | `getTorchVaultPda(creator)` | YES |
| `getVaultForWallet(wallet)` | `getVaultWalletLinkPda(wallet)` → follow `link.vault` | YES |
| `getVaultWalletLink(wallet)` | `getVaultWalletLinkPda(wallet)` | YES |

### Sell, Star, Borrow, Repay — Vault Account Handling

V3.2.0 extends vault routing to all write operations. The SDK passes `torchVault`, `vaultWalletLink`, and (where applicable) `vaultTokenAccount` as optional accounts. When vault is not specified, all three are passed as `null`. The pattern is consistent across all builders — verified by E2E tests covering vault-routed buy, sell, star, borrow, repay, and DEX swap.

### Protocol Rewards — Vault-Routed Claim

`buildClaimProtocolRewardsTransaction` routes epoch reward claims through the vault. The protocol treasury accumulates 0.5% fees from all bonding curve buys. Each epoch, rewards are distributed proportionally to wallets with >= 2 SOL volume in the previous epoch. Min claim: 0.1 SOL. The claim sends SOL directly to the vault — maintaining the closed economic loop. The SDK derives all required accounts (UserStats, ProtocolTreasury, TorchVault, VaultWalletLink) from the caller's public key and vault creator.

**Verdict:** Vault integration is correct and consistent with the on-chain program.

---

## Input Validation

### PublicKey Strings

All public key strings are passed to `new PublicKey(str)` which throws on invalid base58. The SDK does **not** pre-validate these — it relies on the `PublicKey` constructor. This is acceptable since:
- Invalid keys throw immediately with a clear error
- No on-chain transaction is built or submitted with invalid keys

### Slippage Validation

Buy and sell builders validate slippage (transactions.ts):

```typescript
if (slippage_bps < 10 || slippage_bps > 1000) {
  throw new Error(`slippage_bps must be between 10 (0.1%) and 1000 (10%), got ${slippage_bps}`)
}
```

Range: **0.1% to 10%**. Default: **1%** (100 bps). Values outside this range throw an explicit error (previously silently clamped in v3.2.3, resolved in v3.2.4). The buy quote (quotes.ts:47) uses a fixed 1% slippage for `min_output_tokens`, which is independent of the builder's slippage.

### String Length Validation

- Token name: max 32 characters (transactions.ts:346)
- Token symbol: max 10 characters (transactions.ts:347)
- Message: max 500 characters (transactions.ts:206-208, 304-306)

### Numeric Inputs

`amount_sol` and `amount_tokens` are not explicitly validated for zero or negative values. However:
- Zero amounts will produce zero output and fail the on-chain `MIN_SOL_AMOUNT` check (0.001 SOL)
- Negative numbers will produce invalid `BN` values and fail on-chain

---

## External API Surface

### SAID Protocol API

**Endpoint:** `https://api.saidprotocol.com/api`

| Function | Method | Risk |
|----------|--------|------|
| `verifySaid(wallet)` | `GET /verify/{wallet}` | Low |
| `confirmTransaction(...)` | On-chain only (no API call) | None |

`verifySaid` fails gracefully — returns `{ verified: false, trustTier: null }` on any error (said.ts:36-38). This is **read-only** and **non-critical** — it enriches token detail responses but does not affect trading.

### CoinGecko API

**Endpoint:** `https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price`

Used in `getToken()` (tokens.ts:342-349) for SOL/USD conversion. Fails gracefully — adds a warning string but does not throw. Non-critical — `price_usd` and `market_cap_usd` are `undefined` on failure.

### Metadata URI (Token Creator-Controlled)

`getToken()` fetches the metadata URI stored in the on-chain `BondingCurve.uri` field. This URI is **set by the token creator** and could point to any HTTP endpoint.

The SDK:
- Calls `fetch(uri)` with a 10-second `AbortController` timeout (inlined in `tokens.ts`)
- Parses the JSON response for `description`, `image`, `twitter`, `telegram`, `website`
- Fails gracefully — catches errors and adds a warning

**Risk:** The metadata URI is creator-controlled, so a malicious creator could set it to a slow/hostile endpoint. The 10-second timeout aborts the fetch; errors are caught gracefully. This is not in any transaction path.

## Dependency Analysis

### Runtime Dependencies

| Package | Version | Purpose | Risk |
|---------|---------|---------|------|
| `@coral-xyz/anchor` | ^0.32.1 | IDL decoding, program interaction | Low — standard Solana |
| `@solana/spl-token` | ^0.4.14 | ATA derivation, token instructions | Low — standard Solana |
| `@solana/web3.js` | ^1.98.4 | RPC, PublicKey, Transaction | Low — standard Solana |
| `bs58` | ^6.0.0 | Base58 decoding (memo parsing) | Low — pure JS, no native |

### Dev Dependencies

| Package | Version | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `@types/node` | ^20 | TypeScript types |
| `prettier` | ^3.5.3 | Code formatting |
| `typescript` | ^5 | Compilation |

**Verdict:** Minimal dependency surface. All 4 runtime dependencies are standard Solana ecosystem packages. No native modules (except transitive via `@solana/web3.js`). No custom crypto.

---

## Transaction Builder Review

### Key Safety — Unsigned Transaction Pattern

All `build*Transaction` functions return `{ transaction: Transaction, message: string }`. The SDK **never**:
- Accepts private keys or keypairs as parameters (except `buildCreateTokenTransaction` which generates and returns a mint keypair)
- Signs transactions
- Submits transactions to the network

The `makeDummyProvider` pattern (transactions.ts:67-74) creates a no-op wallet for Anchor's `Program` constructor. The dummy wallet's `signTransaction` is a passthrough — it is never called during instruction building.

**One exception:** `buildCreateTokenTransaction` generates a `Keypair` for the mint, partially signs the transaction with it (transactions.ts:398), and returns the keypair. This is by design — the mint must be a signer for Token-2022 initialization. The caller receives the keypair for address extraction. This is not a custody risk since the mint keypair has no authority after creation.

### Account Derivation Consistency

All transaction builders derive accounts locally from PDA functions in `program.ts`. No builder accepts raw account addresses from the caller — all addresses are computed from the mint, buyer/seller, and vault creator parameters. This eliminates account confusion attacks at the SDK level.

### Blockhash Freshness

All transactions call `finalizeTransaction()` which fetches `getLatestBlockhash()` (transactions.ts:76-84). The blockhash is fetched at build time, not at sign time. If there is a long delay between building and signing, the transaction may expire. This is standard behavior for Solana SDKs.

### ~~Auto-Buyback Pre-Checks (v3.7.2)~~ -- REMOVED (V33)

`buildAutoBuybackTransaction` was removed in v3.7.22. The on-chain `execute_auto_buyback` instruction was removed in V33 (program v3.7.7). Treasury SOL is no longer spent on market buys during price dips. The treasury accumulation loop is now: fee harvest → sell high → SOL → lending yield + epoch rewards.

### Harvest Fees Auto-Discovery (v3.7.2)

`buildHarvestFeesTransaction` includes auto-discovery of token accounts with withheld transfer fees:

1. If `sources` param is provided, uses those addresses directly
2. Otherwise calls `getTokenLargestAccounts(mint)` to find candidate accounts
3. For each account, calls `unpackAccount` + `getTransferFeeAmount` to check for withheld fees > 0
4. Passes matching accounts as `remainingAccounts` to the on-chain `harvestFees` instruction
5. Compute budget scales dynamically: `200_000 + 20_000 * sourceAccounts.length`

The entire auto-discovery path is wrapped in a try/catch. If `getTokenLargestAccounts` fails (unsupported by RPC, e.g. Surfpool local validator), the SDK falls back to an empty source list and the transaction still proceeds — the on-chain program harvests from the mint's withheld authority regardless.

**Verdict:** Auto-discovery is a best-effort optimization. Graceful fallback ensures the transaction builder never throws on RPC limitations. The `sources` param provides an escape hatch for callers who know their source accounts.

---

## Findings

### L-1: No Timeout on Metadata URI Fetch — RESOLVED in v3.2.4

**Severity:** Low
**File:** `tokens.ts` (was `gateway.ts`; module removed in v10.3.0)
**Description:** `getToken()` fetches the metadata URI (creator-controlled) without a timeout. A malicious or slow endpoint could cause `getToken()` to hang indefinitely.
**Impact:** Denial of service for `getToken()` callers. Does not affect transaction building.
**Resolution:** Metadata fetch uses `fetch()` + `AbortController` with a 10s timeout. Slow/hanging endpoints are aborted and the error is caught gracefully. (Previously lived in `gateway.ts`; inlined into `tokens.ts` when the gateway module was removed alongside Irys.)

### L-2: Silent Slippage Clamping — RESOLVED in v3.2.4

**Severity:** Low
**File:** `transactions.ts`
**Description:** Slippage values outside the 0.1%-10% range were silently clamped. A caller passing `slippage_bps: 5000` (50%) got 10% without any warning.
**Impact:** Unexpected slippage behavior. Not a fund safety issue — trades fail rather than execute at bad prices.
**Resolution:** Out-of-range `slippage_bps` values now throw an explicit error with the accepted range (10–1000 bps).

### L-3: Hardcoded Discriminator — RESOLVED in v3.2.4

**Severity:** Low
**File:** `tokens.ts`
**Description:** LoanPosition account scanning used a hardcoded 8-byte discriminator array. If the IDL changes (account rename), this would silently break loan enumeration.
**Impact:** `getLendingInfo()` could return incorrect loan counts. No security impact.
**Resolution:** LoanPosition discriminator is now derived from the Anchor IDL via `BorshCoder.accounts.accountDiscriminator('LoanPosition')`. Changes to the IDL are automatically reflected.

### I-1: No Zero Amount Validation

**Severity:** Informational
**File:** `transactions.ts:100-224`
**Description:** Buy and sell builders do not check for zero `amount_sol` or `amount_tokens`. Zero amounts will produce zero-output transactions that fail on-chain (`MIN_SOL_AMOUNT` check).
**Impact:** Wasted transaction fee. The on-chain program rejects the transaction safely.

### I-2: Vote Parameter Encoding — RESOLVED in v10.2.0 (V36)

**Severity:** Informational
**Description:** The `vote` parameter had an inverted encoding (`return → true`, `burn → false`) that could confuse SDK consumers.
**Resolution:** The entire vote mechanism was removed in V36 — `vote` parameter dropped from `BuyArgs` on-chain and from `BuyParams`/`DirectBuyParams` in the SDK. 100% of bought tokens go to the buyer. No inversion remains to document.

### I-3: CoinGecko Rate Limiting

**Severity:** Informational
**File:** `tokens.ts:342-349`
**Description:** The CoinGecko free API has rate limits. High-frequency `getToken()` calls will trigger rate limiting, causing `price_usd` to be unavailable.
**Impact:** Missing USD pricing. Degrades gracefully.

### I-4: Holder Count Uses `getTokenLargestAccounts`

**Severity:** Informational
**File:** `tokens.ts:333-337`
**Description:** Holder count is derived from `getTokenLargestAccounts` which returns at most 20 accounts. For tokens with many holders, this count is an undercount.
**Impact:** Reported holder count may be lower than actual. Non-critical — informational only.

### I-5: Lending Constants are Hardcoded

**Severity:** Informational
**File:** `tokens.ts:504-507`
**Description:** Lending parameters (`INTEREST_RATE_BPS`, `LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD_BPS`, `LIQUIDATION_BONUS_BPS`) are hardcoded in the SDK rather than read from on-chain state. If the on-chain program updates these values, the SDK would report stale parameters.
**Impact:** `getLendingInfo()` could report incorrect rates for fixed parameters. Does not affect transaction building — the on-chain program enforces actual rates. **Note (V10.2.4):** `MAX_LTV_BPS` is no longer hardcoded — the SDK now computes depth-adaptive max LTV by reading pool SOL reserves via `getDepthMaxLtvBps(poolSol)`, matching the on-chain `get_depth_max_ltv_bps()` function.
**Recommendation:** Read remaining fixed lending parameters from on-chain Treasury account if available.
**Status:** Partially resolved (V10.2.4) — max LTV now dynamic, other params still hardcoded.

### I-6: Platform Treasury Removal (V3.2.0)

**Severity:** Informational
**Description:** V3.2.0 merges the platform treasury into the protocol treasury. The `buildClaimEpochRewardsTransaction` function and `ClaimEpochRewardsParams` type have been removed. The `platform_treasury` optional account has been removed from Buy and Sell builders. Reclaim SOL now routes to the protocol treasury instead of the platform treasury. The protocol treasury is now the single reward system — funded by both trading fees and reclaims.
**Impact:** Breaking change for SDK consumers using epoch rewards. All clients must update to v3.2.0.
**Status:** By design. Reduces code surface and eliminates a duplicate reward system.

### I-7: Harvest Auto-Discovery Depends on `getTokenLargestAccounts` (V3.7.2)

**Severity:** Informational
**File:** `transactions.ts`
**Description:** The harvest fees auto-discovery relies on `getTokenLargestAccounts`, an RPC method that is not universally supported. Some RPC providers and local validators (e.g. Surfpool) return internal errors for this method. The SDK wraps this in a try/catch and falls back to an empty source list.
**Impact:** On unsupported RPCs, auto-discovery is silently skipped. The harvest transaction still executes but only harvests from the mint's withheld authority, not from individual token accounts. Callers can use the explicit `sources` parameter as a workaround.
**Status:** By design. Graceful degradation is the correct behavior — the alternative (throwing) would break the builder entirely on unsupported RPCs.

---

## Conclusion

The Torch SDK v4.0.1 is a well-structured, minimal-surface TypeScript library that correctly mirrors the on-chain Torch Market V4.0.1 program. Key findings:

1. **PDA derivation is correct** — all 11 Torch PDAs and 5 Raydium PDAs match the on-chain seeds exactly.
2. **Quote math is correct** — BigInt arithmetic matches the on-chain Rust `checked_mul`/`checked_div` behavior, including the dynamic treasury rate and constant product formula. (The 90/10 buyer/treasury token split was removed in V36; 100% of tokens now go to the buyer.)
3. **Vault integration is correct** — vault PDA derived from creator, wallet link derived from buyer, both null when vault not used.
4. **No key custody** — the SDK never touches private keys. All transactions are returned unsigned.
5. **Minimal dependency surface** — 4 runtime deps, all standard Solana ecosystem.
6. **All low-severity findings resolved** — metadata fetch timeout added, slippage validation made explicit, discriminator derived from IDL. 7 informational issues remain (by design or non-critical).
7. **V3.2.1 on-chain security fix verified** — `harvest_fees` `treasury_token_account` constrained to treasury's exact ATA via Anchor `associated_token` constraints. Independent human auditor gave green flag.
8. **V3.3.0 tiered bonding** — new `sol_target` parameter on `buildCreateTokenTransaction` correctly passes through to on-chain `CreateTokenArgs`. Kani proofs updated and verified for all tiers (20/20 passing).
9. **V3.4.0 tiered fees** — `calculateTokensOut` now accepts `bondingTarget` parameter. Fee tier derived from `bonding_target` — zero new state. Legacy tokens map to Torch bounds.
10. **V3.5.1 pump-style distribution (V25)** — New virtual reserve model: IVS = bonding_target/8, IVT = 900M tokens, ~81x multiplier. Reverted V24 per-tier fees to flat 20%→5% all tiers. 35 Kani proof harnesses (up from 26), including V25 supply conservation.
11. **V3.6.0 permissionless migration (V26)** — Two-step migration: `fundMigrationWsol` + `migrateToDex` in one transaction. New `buildMigrateTransaction` correctly derives all Raydium CPMM PDAs, passes treasury as WSOL funder, payer covers rent. Tested on devnet E2E.
12. **V3.6.0 pool validation (V27)** — AMM config constrained to known constant, pool state ownership verified against Raydium CPMM program ID. Closes account substitution vector for vault swap operations.
13. **V3.7.0 update authority removed (V28)** — The `update_authority` admin instruction was added in V3.6.0 (V28) and subsequently **removed** in V3.7.0. Authority transfer is now done at deployment time via multisig tooling rather than an on-chain instruction, reducing the protocol's admin attack surface. 27 instructions total (down from 28). Minimal admin surface: only `initialize` and `update_dev_wallet` require authority.
14. **Lending `sol_balance` fix** — Treasury `sol_balance` now correctly decremented on borrow and incremented on repay/liquidation. Critical accounting bug resolved.
15. **Lending utilization cap** — `getLendingInfo` now returns `(sol_balance * 50%) - total_sol_lent` as `treasury_sol_available`, matching on-chain enforcement. Previously returned raw `sol_balance`.
16. **Live Raydium pool price** — `getToken()` fetches pool vault balances for migrated tokens, reporting live price instead of frozen bonding curve virtual reserves.
17. **Dynamic network detection** — `isDevnet()` checks `globalThis.__TORCH_NETWORK__` first (browser runtime), then `process.env.TORCH_NETWORK`. Raydium addresses switch automatically. Deprecated static constants preserved for backward compatibility.
18. **Pre-migration buyback removed** — Simplified protocol: only post-migration DEX buyback remained. *(Post-migration buyback also removed in V33 — see #26)*
19. **V3.7.0 treasury lock (V27)** — 250M tokens (25%) locked in TreasuryLock PDA at creation; 750M (75%) for bonding curve. IVS = 3BT/8, IVT = 756.25M tokens — 13.44x multiplier across all tiers. PDA-based Raydium pool validation replaces runtime validation. 36 Kani proof harnesses, all passing.
20. **V3.7.1 treasury cranks** — New `buildHarvestFeesTransaction` harvests accumulated Token-2022 transfer fees from token accounts into the treasury. Permissionless — anyone can trigger. New type: `HarvestFeesParams`. *(Note: `buildAutoBuybackTransaction` was also added in v3.7.1 and removed in v3.7.22 — see #26)*
21. **V3.7.2 harvest auto-discovery pre-checks** — Harvest fees auto-discovery and pre-checks added. *(Buyback pre-checks also added in v3.7.2 and removed in v3.7.22)*
22. **V3.7.2 harvest auto-discovery** — `buildHarvestFeesTransaction` auto-discovers source accounts with withheld fees via `getTokenLargestAccounts` + `unpackAccount` + `getTransferFeeAmount`. Dynamic compute budget (200k base + 20k per source). Try/catch fallback when RPC doesn't support `getTokenLargestAccounts` (I-7). New optional `sources` param for explicit account list.
23. **V3.7.10 swap fees to SOL (V20)** — New `buildSwapFeesToSolTransaction` bundles `create_idempotent(treasury_wsol)` + `harvest_fees` + `swap_fees_to_sol` in one atomic transaction. Sells harvested Token-2022 transfer fee tokens back to SOL via Raydium CPMM. Treasury PDA signs the swap, WSOL ATA closed to unwrap proceeds. SOL added to `treasury.sol_balance` and tracked in `treasury.harvested_fees` (repurposed from unused field). All Raydium accounts PDA-derived. Defense-in-depth: `validate_pool_accounts()` with correct vault ordering via `order_mints()`. New type: `SwapFeesToSolParams`. Fixed vault ordering bug — vaults now passed in pool order (by mint pubkey) instead of swap direction. No new Kani proofs needed (CPI composition, not new arithmetic).

24. **V3.7.17 on-chain metadata (V29)** — Metaplex `buildAddMetadataTransaction` removed (temporary backfill complete — all active tokens now use Token-2022 metadata extensions). New `getTokenMetadata(connection, mint)` read-only function returns `{ name, symbol, uri, mint }` from on-chain Token-2022 metadata. Transfer fee updated from 1% to 0.1% on-chain (`TRANSFER_FEE_BPS` changed from 100 to 10). All Metaplex program references, constants, and instruction builders removed from SDK. IDL updated to v3.7.17 (28 instructions).

25. **V3.7.17 loan position scanner** — New `getAllLoanPositions(connection, mint)` scans all `LoanPosition` accounts for a token via `getProgramAccounts` with discriminator + mint memcmp filters. Decodes accounts using Anchor's BorshCoder, filters active positions (`borrowed_amount > 0`), fetches Raydium pool price once for collateral valuation, computes health status per position (`healthy`/`at_risk`/`liquidatable`/`none`), and returns sorted by liquidation risk (liquidatable first). New types: `LoanPositionWithKey` (extends `LoanPositionInfo` with `borrower` address), `AllLoanPositionsResult` (`positions` array + `pool_price_sol`). Read-only query — no on-chain instruction change. Uses same discriminator derivation pattern as `getTokens()` (Anchor IDL-derived, not hardcoded — per L-3 resolution). The `getProgramAccounts` call applies a 40-byte offset memcmp filter on the mint field, matching the `LoanPosition` account layout (8-byte discriminator + 32-byte mint).

26. **V3.7.22 buyback removal (V33)** — `buildAutoBuybackTransaction` removed (~180 lines). The on-chain `execute_auto_buyback` instruction was removed in V33 (program v3.7.7, 27 instructions). `AutoBuybackParams` type removed. `TreasuryBuybackDex` context removed from on-chain program. Treasury simplified to: fee harvest → sell high → SOL → lending yield + epoch rewards. Lending utilization cap increased from 50% to 70%. IDL updated to v3.7.7. 39 Kani proofs all passing. Binary size reduced ~6% (850 KB → 804 KB). Pure removal — no new SDK code, no new attack surface.

27. **V3.7.29 reclaim failed tokens + per-user borrow cap (V3.7.9)** — New `buildReclaimFailedTokenTransaction` — permissionless reclaim of failed tokens inactive for 7+ days that haven't completed bonding. SOL from both bonding curve and token treasury goes to protocol treasury. New `ReclaimParams` type (`payer`, `mint`). Accounts derived locally: `bondingCurve`, `tokenTreasury`, `protocolTreasury` PDAs — same derivation pattern as other builders. `getTokenStatus` now returns `'reclaimed'` status (previously reclaimed tokens were filtered out entirely in `fetchAllRawTokens`). New `last_activity_at` field on `TokenSummary` (from on-chain `last_activity_slot`). New on-chain per-user borrow cap: max borrow = 3x collateral share of supply. New error code `UserBorrowCapExceeded` (code 6048, all subsequent codes shifted +1). `getLendingInfo` now exposes `utilization_cap_bps` (7000) and `borrow_share_multiplier` (3) in response. Bundled lib `LENDING_UTILIZATION_CAP_BPS` updated from 5000 to 7000 to match V33 on-chain enforcement. IDL updated to v3.7.9. 27 instructions (unchanged). 43 Kani proofs all passing.

28. **V3.7.30 community token option (V35)** — New `community_token?: boolean` parameter on `buildCreateTokenTransaction` (default `true`). Community tokens route 0% to creator — all bonding SOL share and post-migration `swap_fees_to_sol` proceeds go entirely to treasury. Creator tokens (opt-in `community_token: false`) retain V34 behavior: 0.2%→1% bonding SOL share + 15% fee swap share. SDK passes `communityToken: community_token` to the on-chain `createToken` instruction. On-chain implementation uses sentinel value (`u64::MAX`) in deprecated `Treasury.total_bought_back` field — no struct layout changes, full backward compatibility. New on-chain constant `COMMUNITY_TOKEN_SENTINEL`. Stars system unchanged (user-funded appreciation, not protocol fees). No new SDK types, no new SDK functions, no new PDA derivations. IDL updated to v3.7.10. 27 instructions (unchanged). 48 Kani proofs all passing (2 new: `verify_community_token_buy_conservation`, `verify_community_token_swap_fees_conservation`).

29. **V3.7.37 message enrichment** — `getMessages()` now accepts `{ enrich: true }` option. When enabled, the SDK batch-verifies unique message senders via `verifySaid()` and populates four new fields on each message: `sender_verified` (boolean), `sender_trust_tier` (string | null), `sender_said_name` (string | null), `sender_badge_url` (string | null). Verification results are cached per-sender within the call to avoid redundant API hits. The enrichment is opt-in — existing callers are unaffected. `verifySaid` already degrades gracefully (returns `{ verified: false }` on error), so enrichment cannot break message retrieval. No new types — the fields are optional additions to the existing `TokenMessage` type. No on-chain changes. Read-only feature.

30. **V4.0.0 simplified tiers & reduced fees** — Constants-only update. Removed 50 SOL (Spark) tier from `VALID_BONDING_TARGETS` — existing Spark tokens continue to function via `initial_virtual_reserves()`. Treasury SOL rate reduced from 20%→5% to 12.5%→2.5% (`TREASURY_SOL_MAX_BPS` 2000→1250, `TREASURY_SOL_MIN_BPS` 500→250). Protocol fee reduced from 1% to 0.5% (`PROTOCOL_FEE_BPS` 100→50). Per-user borrow cap increased from 3x to 5x (`BORROW_SHARE_MULTIPLIER` 3→5). Lending utilization cap increased from 70% to 80% (`DEFAULT_LENDING_UTILIZATION_CAP_BPS` 7000→8000). SDK constants updated in `tokens.ts` (`LENDING_UTILIZATION_CAP_BPS` 7000→8000, `BORROW_SHARE_MULTIPLIER` 3→5) and `quotes.ts` (fallback multiplier 3→5). IDL updated to v4.0.0. 27 instructions (unchanged). 48 Kani proofs all passing.

30. **V4.0.1 flattened bonding treasury fee** — Constants-only update. Treasury SOL rate increased from 12.5%→2.5% to 12.5%→4% (`TREASURY_SOL_MIN_BPS` 250→400). This is justified due to the increased available SOL in the treasury for lending post migration, ensuring each tier meets the minimum borrow threshold. IDL updated to v4.0.1. 27 instructions (unchanged). 48 Kani proofs all passing.

31. **V4.1.0 VersionedTransaction + Quote-Driven Trading** — Major SDK improvement, no on-chain program changes. All transaction builders now return `VersionedTransaction` (v0 messages) instead of legacy `Transaction`. Address Lookup Tables hardcoded for mainnet (`GQzbU32oN3znZa3uWFKGc9cBukpQbYYJSirKstMuFF3i`) and devnet (`3umSStZSLJNk5QstxeQB12a2MSDh4o8RgSzT76gigJ8P`) — 14 static addresses compressed from 32 bytes to 1 byte each. `getBuyQuote`/`getSellQuote` now work on migrated tokens using Raydium CPMM constant product formula with 25 bps fee; both return `source: 'bonding' | 'dex'`. `BuyParams`/`SellParams`/`DirectBuyParams` accept optional `quote` field — when provided, the builder uses `quote.source` for automatic routing (bonding curve vs vault swap) and `quote.min_output_*` for slippage protection. `buildVaultSwapTransaction` internalized (removed from public API); `buildBuyTransaction` and `buildSellTransaction` auto-route through vault swap for migrated tokens. `VaultSwapParams` removed from exports. `getRaydiumMigrationAccounts` removed from public API. Deprecated constants removed (`RAYDIUM_CPMM_PROGRAM`, `RAYDIUM_AMM_CONFIG`, `RAYDIUM_FEE_RECEIVER`). DRY helpers extracted: `deriveVaultAccounts`, `createVaultTokenAtaIx`, `getVaultTokenAta`, `addMemoIx` — replacing 7+ duplicate code blocks across transaction builders. `EphemeralAgent.sign()` now handles both `VersionedTransaction` (`.sign([keypair])`) and legacy `Transaction` (`.partialSign(keypair)`). E2E tests updated with bonding curve quote output, DEX quote output, transaction size logging, and unified buy/sell flow for post-migration trading. No new on-chain instructions. IDL unchanged at v4.0.1. 48 Kani proofs all passing.

32. **V4.1.2 sendBuy/sendDirectBuy + WalletAdapter + Default-All Pagination** — SDK-only change, no on-chain program changes. New `sendBuy(connection, wallet, params)` and `sendDirectBuy(connection, wallet, params)` — high-level helpers that build, simulate, and submit a buy via `wallet.signAndSendTransaction()`. Recommended for Phantom and other browser wallets: atomic sign+send avoids false-positive "malicious dapp" warnings. Both handle auto-migration when a buy completes bonding (simulates migration tx, submits if valid). New `WalletAdapter` interface in `types.ts` — minimal `{ publicKey: PublicKey, signAndSendTransaction: (tx) => Promise<{ signature }> }`. `getTokens()` pagination changed: previously defaulted to `limit: 50`; now returns all tokens when no `limit` specified (`filterAndSort` only slices when `params.limit` or `params.offset` is set). `TokenListResult.limit` returns `summaries.length` instead of hardcoded 50 when no limit specified. No new on-chain instructions. IDL unchanged at v4.0.1. 48 Kani proofs all passing.

33. **V10.0.1 Short selling accounts fix + getShortPosition** — Bug fix: `buildOpenShortTransaction`, `buildCloseShortTransaction`, and `buildLiquidateShortTransaction` now correctly pass `treasuryLock` and `treasuryLockTokenAccount` (the 300M token lending pool) instead of `treasuryTokenAccount` (the treasury's vote vault ATA). This aligns the SDK with the on-chain IDL — the previous code would have failed at the program level. New read-only `getShortPosition(connection, mint, wallet)` returns short position state (SOL collateral, tokens borrowed, accrued interest, LTV, health). No new signing paths, no new attack surface. All other changes in v10 are copy, branding, and frontend — no SDK security implications. 58 Kani proofs, 59 E2E tests all passing.

34. **V10.1.0 Treasury rate rebalance** — Constants-only SDK update matching on-chain V10.1. `TREASURY_SOL_MAX_BPS` 1250→1500 (15%), `TREASURY_SOL_MIN_BPS` 400→250 (2.5%). `treasuryFeeBps` default 100→0 (token treasury fee removed). IDL updated to V10.1.1. No new instructions, no new signing paths. 58 Kani proofs, 59 E2E tests all passing.

35. **V10.1.1 Free Authority Revocation on Launch** — All tokens now launch with freeze authority disabled instead of being disabled on migration.

36. **V10.2.0 Vote vault removal (V36)** — `BURN_RATE_BPS` removed, 100% of `tokens_out` goes to buyer (was 90/10 split). `vote` parameter removed from `BuyArgs` (IDL change). `BuyParams`/`DirectBuyParams` no longer accept `vote`. `calculateTokensOut` returns `tokensToUser == tokensOut` (removed `tokensToCommunity`). `BuyQuoteResult` no longer has `tokens_to_treasury`. `TokenDetail` no longer has `tokens_in_vote_vault`, `votes_return`, `votes_burn`. `TREASURY_SOL_MAX_BPS` increased from 1500 (15%) to 1750 (17.5%). New `sendCreateToken(connection, wallet, params)` — Phantom-friendly token creation via `signAndSendTransaction` (pre-simulates with `sigVerify: false`, avoids malicious dapp warning from partially-signed mint keypair). `irysToArweave` replaces `irysToUploader` in `gateway.ts` (Irys gateway dead, all reads via arweave.net). 6 tokens blacklisted (Irys data loss). IDL updated to v10.2.0. 58 Kani proofs, 59 E2E tests all passing.

37. **V10.3.0 SDK-only dead-code cleanup** — No on-chain changes. `src/gateway.ts` removed entirely (Irys project deprecated); metadata fetch inlined into `tokens.ts` as direct `fetch()` + 10s `AbortController` timeout (same security property as before, simpler surface). `VOTE_SEED` constant and `getVoteRecordPda()` helper removed from `program.ts` (TS-only scaffolding, zero callers — dead since V36). `'governance_vote'` variant removed from `ConfirmResult.event_type` union; corresponding log-parse branch removed from `said.ts`. Stale `[V36]` / `[V13]` / `[V34]` version-gate scar comments scrubbed from `types.ts`, `transactions.ts`, `program.ts`, and `constants.ts`. `BondingCurve` interface retains the `vote_*` fields (`vote_vault_balance`, `votes_return`, `votes_burn`, `total_voters`, `vote_finalized`, `vote_result_return`) — these bytes still occupy slots in the on-chain struct and removing them would misalign Anchor deserialization; a single comment at the interface documents this. New public exports: `getTorchVaultPda`, `getVaultWalletLinkPda`, `getBondingCurvePda` from `program.ts` (advanced-usage helpers — e.g. reading vault-owned ATAs directly without the full SDK read helpers). Misleading docstring on `buildMigrateTransaction` corrected: it previously claimed the buy "auto-bundles migration" when in fact `buildBuyTransaction` returns a **separate** `migrationTransaction` that the caller must send alongside the buy. **Net effect:** ~180 lines removed, no behavior change, no new signing paths, no new attack surface. I-2 (vote parameter encoding) marked RESOLVED. No Kani proofs affected (cleanup is SDK-side, doesn't touch arithmetic).

38. **V10.4.0 SDK completeness pass — no more IDL hacks for end users** — SDK-only change, no on-chain program changes. Three behavior fixes + public-surface expansion driven by auditing where the SDK's own e2e test was reaching below the public API. **Fixes:** `buildBorrowTransaction`, `buildRepayTransaction`, and `buildCloseShortTransaction` now idempotently create the user's personal Token-2022 ATA before the program instruction (matching the pattern already present in `buildLiquidateTransaction`, `buildOpenShortTransaction`, `buildLiquidateShortTransaction`). On-chain the `borrow`/`repay`/`close_short` instructions declare the borrower/shorter token account as `mut` + non-optional (verified in IDL), so the handler requires it to exist even in vault mode — collateral flows vault ATA → user ATA → collateral_vault. Integrators who only ever bought via vault previously hit `AccountNotInitialized` here; the SDK now handles the intermediate ATA creation itself. No new attack surface — idempotent ATA creation has the same semantics whether or not the account already exists. **New public builder:** `buildAdvanceProtocolEpochTransaction(connection, { payer })` + `AdvanceProtocolEpochParams` type. Wraps the permissionless `advance_protocol_epoch` crank that rolls the protocol epoch forward so the previous epoch's trading-volume-weighted rewards become claimable via `buildClaimProtocolRewardsTransaction`. Previously required integrators to instantiate Anchor and call `.methods.advanceProtocolEpoch().rpc()` directly — the SDK's own test was doing this, which was the clearest signal the surface was incomplete. **New public exports from `index.ts`:** constants (`TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID`, `WSOL_MINT`, `PROTOCOL_TREASURY_SEED`) and PDA/ATA derivers (`getProtocolTreasuryPda`, `getTokenTreasuryPda`, `getTreasuryTokenAccount`, `getRaydiumMigrationAccounts`). These were already defined in `program.ts` / `constants.ts` but unreachable from the public entry. Integrators legitimately need them for advanced flows — e.g. deriving Raydium pool vaults for post-migration price reads, or resolving the treasury's Token-2022 ATA for balance checks. **Test cleanup:** all `require('../src/program')`, `require('../dist/torch_market.json')`, hardcoded `TOKEN_2022` PublicKey literals, raw `Program(idl, provider)` / `AnchorProvider` instantiation, and hand-rolled `PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync` calls for well-known PDAs were removed from `tests/test_e2e.ts`. The test now exercises the SDK entirely through its public surface, which is the correctness condition for any SDK — if the test needs IDL hacks, the SDK is incomplete. Three duplicated inline `getVaultTokenBalance` helpers consolidated into one test-local helper composed from public SDK exports. The pre-migration bonding curve snapshot now uses `fetchTokenRaw` instead of instantiating Anchor. **Net effect:** `buildAdvanceProtocolEpochTransaction` is the first new instruction builder since v10.2.0; 7 new constants/PDA exports added; 3 silent-failure-in-vault-mode bugs fixed; test_e2e.ts now runs through public API only. No Kani proofs affected — changes are SDK-side and don't touch arithmetic or account-layout invariants.

39. **V10.5.0 off-chain interest projection — closes a visibility gap for liquidation scanners** — SDK-only change, no on-chain program changes. Surfaced by the torch-liquidation-kit e2e test: after a 490-day time-travel, a loan at ~28% LTV with an uncomputed interest accrual displayed `health='healthy'`, because the SDK's read functions (`getLoanPosition`, `getShortPosition`, `getAllLoanPositions`) returned the raw stored `accrued_interest` from the `LoanPosition`/`ShortPosition` accounts. On-chain, `accrue_interest()` runs only inside mutating instructions (borrow/repay/liquidate/open_short/close_short/liquidate_short) — so the stored value is frozen at `last_update_slot` until someone touches the position. Off-chain scanners saw perpetually-stale health, producing a deadlock: the bot couldn't find a liquidatable target → nobody touched the loan → the stored interest never updated → the loan never *looked* liquidatable, even though the on-chain program would happily liquidate it if anyone called. **Fix:** added `projectAccruedInterest(principal, stored, last_update_slot, current_slot, rate_bps)` matching the on-chain formula in `programs/torch_market/src/handlers/lending.rs:accrue_interest` exactly (`interest = principal × rate_bps × slots_elapsed / (10_000 × EPOCH_DURATION_SLOTS)`, 7-day epochs, simple-linear, u128 math via BigInt to preserve precision at long horizons). The three read functions now fetch `connection.getSlot('confirmed')` alongside account data, project interest forward, and derive `total_owed` / `current_ltv_bps` / `health` from the projected value. **New fields on `LoanPositionInfo` and `ShortPositionInfo`:** `accrued_interest_stored` (raw on-chain value as of `last_update_slot`) and `last_update_slot` itself — so callers who need the instant-of-signing value for exact repay sizing can get it, while `accrued_interest` carries the projected value used for health. The formula is read verbatim from the Rust source, so the projection matches what the program will compute at the next touch; no drift, no overestimation. **Regression guards:** added explicit `getLoanPosition(...).health === 'liquidatable'` and `getShortPosition(...).health === 'liquidatable'` assertions in `tests/test_e2e.ts` between the time-travel step and the liquidation call, in both M6-equivalent (long) and M7 (short) flows. These assertions would fail immediately if someone reverted the projection, which prior to this change never happened — the test ran the liquidation tx and trusted the on-chain accrual to handle it, which masked the off-chain visibility gap. **Net effect:** no new public builders, 2 new transparent fields per position type, 3 read functions now slot-aware, 2 new regression guards. No on-chain changes, no new signing paths, no new attack surface. The fix makes the SDK's view of `health` match what the on-chain liquidate handler will compute at instruction time — a correctness alignment, not a new feature. 57 E2E tests all passing (including the two new projection-health guards).

40. **V10.6.0 two new read helpers — `getUserStats` and `getProtocolTreasuryState`** — SDK-only change, no on-chain program changes. Surfaced by the torchmarket frontend migration: the app was using raw `BorshCoder(idl).accounts.decode('UserStats', ...)` and `.decode('ProtocolTreasury', ...)` calls because the SDK didn't expose these reads. That forced the frontend to maintain its own TS interfaces mirroring the on-chain structs, duplicate the PDA derivations (`getUserStatsPda`, `getProtocolTreasuryPda`), and import the raw IDL — all shadow copies of SDK internals, none of which are supposed to be the frontend's concern. **New public readers:** `getUserStats(connection, wallet)` returns `UserStatsInfo | null` with lifetime/current-epoch/previous-epoch volumes in SOL, rewards-claimed history, and the last claimed epoch. `getProtocolTreasuryState(connection)` returns `ProtocolTreasuryInfo | null` with the current epoch, aggregate trading volumes, total distributed, reserve floor, and the distributable-amount pool that backs reward claims. Both follow the existing `getVault` / `getLoanPosition` pattern exactly — decode via `BorshCoder`, convert BN → number, divide by `LAMPORTS_PER_SOL` where the on-chain field is denominated in lamports. **New public types:** `UserStatsInfo` and `ProtocolTreasuryInfo` in `types.ts`. **New internal types:** `UserStats` and `ProtocolTreasury` raw-struct interfaces in `program.ts` matching the IDL layout — these were previously absent and the frontend was rebuilding them by hand. **E2E coverage:** the existing vault-routed claim-protocol-rewards test (section [22]) now reads both accessors pre-claim and post-claim with four new regression guards: pre-claim asserts `ProtocolTreasury.total_volume_previous_epoch_sol > 0` after the epoch roll and `UserStats.volume_previous_epoch_sol > 0` for the active user; post-claim asserts `UserStats.total_rewards_claimed_sol` increased monotonically, `last_epoch_claimed` now equals the epoch that was just claimed, and `ProtocolTreasury.total_distributed_sol` incremented by at least the claimed amount. These assertions would fail immediately if the readers drift from on-chain semantics. **Net effect:** 2 new public readers, 2 new `*Info` response types, 2 new raw-struct interfaces added to internal `program.ts`, 4 new regression-guard checkpoints. No on-chain changes, no new builders, no new signing paths, no new attack surface. Frontend integrators (and the torchmarket app itself) can now delete their shadow `UserStats` / `ProtocolTreasury` interfaces, drop the raw IDL import for these two accounts, and consume the SDK's typed response objects directly. 61 E2E tests all passing (57 pre-10.6.0 + 3 new: pre-claim volume check, post-claim rewards-delta + epoch assertion, post-claim protocol-distributed delta). One off-by-one assertion caught during first run — `last_epoch_claimed` stores the epoch *claimed for*, not *when claimed* (docstring on `UserStatsInfo.last_epoch_claimed` updated to make this explicit for integrators).

41. **V10.7.0 / V10.7.1 — `getTreasuryState` per-token treasury reader + readme catch-up** — SDK-only change, no on-chain program changes. Surfaced (again) by the torchmarket frontend migration: even after 10.6.0 added `getUserStats` and `getProtocolTreasuryState`, the frontend still had two `BorshCoder.decode('Treasury', ...)` sites — one in the API route layer (`api/tokens.ts`), one in the per-token hook (`useToken.ts`). The pattern was identical to the 10.6.0 gap: the SDK didn't expose the per-token Treasury account, so consumers built their own decoder + their own raw `Treasury` interface. **New public reader:** `getTreasuryState(connection, mint)` returns `TreasuryInfo | null` with the per-token treasury's SOL balance, tokens held, harvested transfer fees (cumulative, in SOL), baseline pool reserves captured at migration (used downstream for depth-adaptive LTV), star count, and the four deprecated buyback fields (kept for binary-compat reads against legacy state, marked `@deprecated` in the type docstrings). Mirrors the existing `getUserStats` / `getProtocolTreasuryState` pattern: `BorshCoder` decode against the canonical `Treasury` discriminator, BN → number, lamports → SOL where appropriate, returns `null` if the account doesn't exist yet. **New public type:** `TreasuryInfo` in `types.ts`. The internal raw-struct `Treasury` interface in `program.ts` is unchanged — it still mirrors the on-chain layout for the SDK's own internal use. **E2E coverage:** new `[M1b]` checkpoint after `getLendingInfo` reads `getTreasuryState(connection, mint)` post-migration and asserts `mint` matches the test mint, `baseline_initialized === true` (set during the migration handler), and `sol_balance_sol > 0` (treasury accumulates SOL during bonding). One new regression-guard checkpoint. **10.7.1** is a docs-only follow-up: the readme's Queries table was missing the new reader; added the row alongside `getUserStats` and `getProtocolTreasuryState` so external integrators can discover it. **Net effect:** 1 new public reader, 1 new `*Info` response type, 1 new e2e checkpoint, readme synced. No on-chain changes, no new builders, no new signing paths, no new attack surface. The torchmarket frontend can now drop its remaining `Treasury` shadow decoder. 62 E2E tests all passing (61 pre-10.7.0 + 1 new `getTreasuryState` checkpoint).

42. **V11.0.0 / V11.1.0 — hardening pass + expanded litesvm coverage** — Both SDK and on-chain program bumped to V11.1.0. Scope was defensive hardening of existing handlers (`programs/torch_market/src/handlers/lending.rs`, `handlers/short.rs`, `contexts.rs`, `migration.rs`) and expanded litesvm test coverage (`tests/litesvm/lending.rs`, `short.rs`, `tier_b.rs`) — 97 litesvm tests passing. Notable behavior changes: rent refund on full repay / short close (closing handlers now return SOL rent to the closer via standard close-account pattern); additional `has_one` / signer constraints on the Buy context (strictly additive); depth-floor liquidation gate relaxed (documented design trade-off in `docs/risk.md` — the underlying oracle-manipulation surface area is pre-existing and acknowledged); `migration.rs` transfer-fee calculation tolerant of mints without the Token-2022 TransferFee extension (defaults to zero fee when extension absent — no exploitable rounding asymmetry). Full security review on 2026-05-19 by Claude Opus 4.7 over the complete diff against the Anchor/Solana threat model (account validation, PDA confusion, arithmetic, oracle manipulation, CPI ordering, authority confusion, migration gating) — **NO FINDINGS** (no HIGH or MEDIUM ≥8-confidence vulnerabilities introduced). New TypeScript SDK package shipped to npm under `packages/sdk/`, first published at v11.0.0; v11.1.0 syncs SDK + on-chain version stamps and lands the hardening + litesvm test additions. No new on-chain instructions, no new public SDK builders, no new signing paths.

The SDK is safe for production use by AI agents and applications interacting with the Torch Market protocol.

Updated February 23, 2026 for v3.7.17 loan position scanner (`getAllLoanPositions` — batch scan all loan positions for a token with health computation). Updated February 26, 2026 for v3.7.22 (V33 buyback removal — `buildAutoBuybackTransaction` and `AutoBuybackParams` removed, on-chain `execute_auto_buyback` instruction removed, lending cap 50%→70%, IDL v3.7.7, 27 instructions, 39 Kani proofs). Updated March 3, 2026 for v3.7.29 (reclaim failed tokens — new `buildReclaimFailedTokenTransaction`, `ReclaimParams`, `reclaimed` token status, `last_activity_at` field; per-user borrow cap with `UserBorrowCapExceeded` error; `getLendingInfo` exposes `utilization_cap_bps` and `borrow_share_multiplier`; IDL v3.7.9, 27 instructions, 43 Kani proofs). Updated March 4, 2026 for v3.7.30 (V35 community token option — new `community_token` param on `buildCreateTokenTransaction`, default true, 0% creator fees for community tokens; IDL v3.7.10, 27 instructions, 48 Kani proofs). Updated March 10, 2026 for v3.7.37 (message enrichment — `getMessages` with `{ enrich: true }` batch-verifies senders via SAID Protocol, populates `sender_verified`, `sender_trust_tier`, `sender_said_name`, `sender_badge_url`; opt-in, read-only, no on-chain changes). Updated March 19, 2026 for v4.1.2 (`sendBuy`/`sendDirectBuy` helpers, `WalletAdapter` interface, default-all pagination). Updated April 19, 2026 for v10.3.0 (SDK-only dead-code cleanup — `gateway.ts` removed, vote-related TS scaffolding scrubbed, new PDA-deriver exports; no on-chain changes, no new signing paths). Updated April 19, 2026 for v10.4.0 (SDK completeness pass — new `buildAdvanceProtocolEpochTransaction` builder, 7 new constant/PDA exports, idempotent personal ATA creation added to `buildBorrowTransaction`/`buildRepayTransaction`/`buildCloseShortTransaction`; tests/test_e2e.ts cleaned to use only the public SDK surface; no on-chain changes). Updated April 19, 2026 for v10.5.0 (off-chain interest projection in `getLoanPosition`/`getShortPosition`/`getAllLoanPositions` — projects stored `accrued_interest` forward to the current slot using the on-chain formula, so off-chain scanners and bots see accurate `health`/`current_ltv_bps` without needing to touch the position first; new `accrued_interest_stored` and `last_update_slot` fields preserve the raw on-chain values for callers who need instant-of-signing amounts; two regression guards added to test_e2e.ts asserting projected health is `liquidatable` between time-travel and liquidation; no on-chain changes, no new signing paths). Updated April 19, 2026 for v10.6.0 (two new public read helpers — `getUserStats` and `getProtocolTreasuryState` — so the torchmarket frontend can drop its shadow `BorshCoder` decoding for `UserStats` and `ProtocolTreasury` accounts; four new e2e regression guards around the claim-protocol-rewards flow verifying volume → distributable → claimed accounting; no on-chain changes, no new signing paths). Updated April 19, 2026 for v10.7.0 / v10.7.1 (new `getTreasuryState(connection, mint)` per-token treasury reader + `TreasuryInfo` response type, closes the last frontend BorshCoder gap for `Treasury` accounts; new `[M1b]` e2e checkpoint asserts `mint` match, `baseline_initialized` post-migration, and positive sol_balance; readme caught up to mention the new reader in 10.7.1; no on-chain changes, no new signing paths). Updated May 19, 2026 for v11.0.0 / v11.1.0 (hardening pass on `lending.rs`/`short.rs`/`contexts.rs`/`migration.rs` — rent refund on full repay/close, additional `has_one` constraints on Buy, relaxed depth-floor on liquidations per documented design trade-off in `docs/risk.md`, transfer-fee calc tolerant of mints without TransferFee extension; expanded litesvm test coverage; SDK + on-chain both bumped to V11.1.0; full security review came back NO FINDINGS). All source files were read in full and cross-referenced against the on-chain program. The E2E test suite validates the SDK against a Surfpool mainnet fork. Separate devnet E2E test validates the full lifecycle including V26 migration on Solana devnet. Tiers E2E test validates harvest and lending across Flame/Torch. Independent human security auditor verified the on-chain program and frontend.
